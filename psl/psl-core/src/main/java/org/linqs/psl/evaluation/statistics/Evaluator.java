 * Compute some metric (or set of matrics) for some predicted and labeled data.
 * Every evaluator will have some "representative metric" that is usually set through config options.
 * For example, a discrete Evaluator may have F1 as its representative metric.
 * This is so that more automated methods like search-based weight learning and CLI evaluation
 * can easily access all types of metrics through a common interface.
 * The evaluator will also have to provide some indication as to if higher values for the
 * representative metric is better than lower values.
 * In addition to the representative metric, subclasses classes will usually
 * provide their own methods to access specific metrics.
 *
 * One of the compute methods must be called before attempting to get statistics.
